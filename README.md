# Nikki's Upgrades

**A mod that adds 3 highly configurable upgrades to the game, with a wide variety of effects!** <br>

Featuring custom box art to make sure that the upgrades fit in more seamlessly than a lot of other mods. <br>

All upgrades are configurable and can be enabled/disabled, as well as having configs for various specifics for each upgrade. More configs coming soon. <br>

I've spent way more time modding games than I ever thought I would. If you'd like to donate to help me make more content like this, I have a Ko-Fi here: [Ko-Fi link <3](http://ko-fi.com/nikkidarkmatter)

## Upgrades (Spoilers Ahead!)

**Stamina Regen Upgrade:** The simplest of the upgrades, this upgrade increases your Stamina Regen by 50% of the base value per upgrade (configurable). Designed to reduce the amount of time you spend hiding so you can get back into the action. <br>

**Investor Upgrade:** For those who like seeing big money numbers, the Investor upgrade grants you interest on your unspent money. For each Investor upgrade across the team, your unspent money increases by 10% *after* you leave the shop. Also increases your money by 10% when initially used, but only if used when in the Lobby after the Shop. Default max of 3 (configurable). <br>

**Unstable Core Upgrade:** When you die, take everything around you with it! You become a volatile explosive when you die, dealing 250 damage to enemies and 100 damage to players (configurable) per level of Unstable Core you have and sending them flying. Additionally, if you have 3 or more Unstable Core upgrades, you can tumble missile yourself into enemies or other players, detonating instantly. *However*, if you have 3 or more upgrades, you also have a small chance to blow up when you take ANY damage, so you have to play cautiously! Most settings configurable. <br>

*Note:* Prices and such currently aren't configurable as 1. It's somewhat tedious and I wanted to release this, and 2. I want people to experience the upgrades as intended for a bit before I add these settings. More config options for base settings such as price will come in the future!
